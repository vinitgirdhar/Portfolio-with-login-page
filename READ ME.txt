In this project, I integrated Google Sheets with a MySQL database to facilitate seamless data management and accessibility. By using the Google Sheets API and PHP, I created a dynamic system where data entered in a Google Sheet is automatically synced with the MySQL database. This allows for real-time updates and easy data manipulation without the need for direct database access.

Key Features:

Data Synchronization: Any changes made in the Google Sheets are reflected in the MySQL database instantly, ensuring that the database always contains the most up-to-date information.
User-Friendly Interface: The use of Google Sheets provides a familiar and intuitive interface for data entry and management, making it accessible for users without technical expertise.
Efficient Data Management: This integration streamlines data handling processes, allowing for efficient record keeping, reporting, and analysis.


CODE UPLOADED ON GOOGLE SPREAD SHEET 

function doPost(e) {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
  
  // Parse form data sent via POST request
  var name = e.parameter.name;
  var email = e.parameter.email;
  var loginTime = new Date();

  // Append the data to the sheet
  sheet.appendRow([name, email, loginTime]);

  // Create a response for the form submission
  return ContentService.createTextOutput("Data stored successfully");
}
